## ND2 tree

### Procedure

First a document was made with all the sequences for the Gene I was looking at

In this case the marker ND2 was used for all of the species of coral that I have been using in the PCRs

here are a list of all the codes used; 
[ND2 sequences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-2-ND2_Sequences %})


These were then shortened to be the samelength and aligned using the program AliView <https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/>

Then using the website Cipres <https://www.phylo.org> the aligned sequences were analysed using the RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE tool to create a Phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood 


The code was produced and adjusted using the following codes

| Code | Species |
|---------|-------------------|
|KP777815.1 |Eunicea mammosa |
|AY126379.1 |Eunicea fusca |
|KP777810.1 |Eunicea laciniata | 
|AY684593.1 |Eunicea clavigera |
|KP777816.1 |Eunicea calyculata |
|KP777813.1 |Eunicea tayrona |
|AY684592.1 |Eunicea asperula |
|AY126378.1 |Eunicea tourneforti |
|AY126376.1 |Eunicea knighti |
|AY684587.1 |Eunicea laxispica |
|AY684588.1 |Eunicea succinea |
|KP777812.1 |Eunicea pallida |
|AY126382.1 |Plexaura homomalla |
|AY126385.1 |Plexaurella grisea |
|AY126384.1 |Plexaura kuna |
|AY684590.1 |Plexaura flexuosa |

(Plexaura kuna,(((Eunicea succinea,Eunicea laxispica),(Eunicea calyculata,Eunicea mammosa)),((((Eunicea knighti,(Eunicea fusca,Plexaura flexuosa)),(Eunicea tayrona,Eunicea pallida)),(((Eunicea clavigera,Eunicea laciniata),Eunicea asperula),Eunicea tourneforti)),Plexaura homomalla)),Plexaurella grisea):0.0;

finally using the site ITOL <https://itol.embl.de> a tree was made:

![07-02-19_ND2_Tree1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/07-02-19_ND2_Tree1.png "7/2/19 ND2 tree #1")


This tree can be shown in other ways as well

ignoring branch length:

 ![07-02-19_ND2_Tree4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/07-02-19_ND2_tree4.png "7/2/19 ND2 tree")

Circular:

 ![07-02-19_ND2_Tree2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/07-02-19_ND2_tree2.png "7/2/19 ND2 tree circular")

Uprooted:

 ![07-02-19_ND2_Tree3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/07-02-19_ND2_tree3.png "7/2/19 ND2 tree uprooted")


## Analysis 

This tree shows the maximum liklihood tree for the ND2 marker
Since this tree was made with only one marker and one sequence from each species the results are not conclusive.

That is why in the study I am conducting many markers will be used and multiples of each species as well
