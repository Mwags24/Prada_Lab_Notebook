##  52°C annealing temp:  E47 E48 E49 E50 E51 E52 P7 P8 P9 P10 P11 P12

### Procedure

Samples  E47 E48 E49 E50 E51 E52 P7 P8 P9 P10 P11 P12 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, CA4.86R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), CA4.86L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 28 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 2x 132.3 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 2x 183.75 micoleters|
|CA4.86R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 2x 14.7 micoleters|
|CA4.86L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 2x 14.7 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 28 tubes 
For the 4 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
E2 was used as the positive control

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 
the annealing temperature was changed from 50°C to 52°C to see if this would get rid of the extra band showing up in the Gels

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|**52°C**|1:00|35|
|4|72°C|0:15|35|
|5|72°C|2:00|1|
|6|4°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E47 E48 E49 E50 E51 E52 P7 P8 P9 P10 P11 P12 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 


| Ladder | E47 | E28 | E49 | Negative Control | E50 | E51 | E52 | Positive Control (E2) |
| Ladder | P7 | P8 | P9 | Negative Control | P10 | P11 | P12 | Positive Control (E2) |


The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
