##  E16 E17 E19 E24 E30 E32 / E34 E35 E48 E52 E53 P15
### Procedure

Samples  E16 E17 E19 E24 E30 E32 E34 E35 E48 E52 E53 P15 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 132.3 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 183.75 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
**for the positive control E1 was used**

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

**The number of cycles was increased to 40**

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|**40**|
|3|52°C|0:40|**40**|
|4|72°C|0:30|**40**|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

___________

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E16 E17 E19 E24 E30 E32 E34 E35 E48 E52 E53 P15  and the four controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E16 | E17 | E19 | Negative Control | E24 | E30 | E32 | Positive Control (E1)|
| Ladder | E34 | E35 | E48 | Negative Control | E52 | E53 | P15 | Positive Control (E1)|

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

This PCR used a positive control. having both positive and negative controls makes it easier to understand what happened if something went wrong

In this PCR the cycles were increased to 40 in hopes of amplifiing the samples that have not been amplifying.
