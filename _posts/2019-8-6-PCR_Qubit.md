## E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5

### Procedure

8119.2 microleters of buffer and 40.8 microleters of quant-it reagent were mixed into a master mixed
for 40 reactions (should have been 42)

190 microleters of the master mix was mixed with 10 microleters of standard 1 and standard 2
199 microleters of the master mix was mixed with 1 microleter of each DNA sample 

The samples were run through the Qubit on the dsDNA - Broad Range setting.
The nanograms of DNA per microleter was determinded

**All of these are in ng/Î¼l**

### Notes

* X = ran out of Mastermix for P4 and P5 for ITS1

* P5 for 28S was weak in the PCR and came out as ~8.3
