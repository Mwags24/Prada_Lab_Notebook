## E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5

### Procedure

8119.2 microleters of buffer and 40.8 microleters of quant-it reagent were mixed into a master mixed
for 40 reactions (should have been 42) + a 2% error 

190 microleters of the master mix was mixed with 10 microleters of standard 1 and standard 2
199 microleters of the master mix was mixed with 1 microleter of each post-PCR DNA sample 

The samples were run through the Qubit on the dsDNA - Broad Range setting.
The nanograms of DNA per microleter was determinded

For 24F **E1-5** was taken from the [7-15-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-15-24F_PCR1 %}) tube. **P1-5** was taken from the [7-16-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-16-24F_PCR5 %}) tube

For 28S **E1-5** was taken from the [7-17-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-17-28S_PCR1 %}) tube. **P1-5** was taken from the [7-22-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-22-28S_PCR5 %})

For IA2 **E1-5** was taken from [7-23-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-23-IA2_PCR1 %}). 
**P1 and P3-5** was taken from [7-24-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-24-IA2_PCR5 %}) **P2** was from [7-29-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-29-IA2_PCR6 %}).

For ITS1 **E1 E2 E3 and E5** was taken from [6-18-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-18-ITS1_PCR1 %}) and **E4** was taken from [6-19-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-19-ITS1_PCR6 %}). 
**P1-5** was taken from [6-19-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-19-ITS1_PCR5 %}).

### Notes

* X = ran out of Mastermix for P4 and P5 for ITS1

* P5 for 28S was weak in the PCR and came out as ~8.3  

This Data will be used to create aloquates to send to be sequenced.
