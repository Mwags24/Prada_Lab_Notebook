##  E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E4 E7 E34 E36 E37 P2 

### Procedure

Samples E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E4 E7 E34 E36 E37 P2 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, ITS1 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), ITS1intrev2 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 132.3 micoleters |
|2x mytaq mix| 183.75 micoleters |
|ITS1 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters |
|ITS1intrev2 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters |

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
E1 was used as a positive control

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|59°C|1:00|35|
|4|72°C|0:15|35|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|4°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E4 E7 E34 E36 E37 P2 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | P53 | P54 | P13 | Negative Control | P14 | P15 | P16 | Positive Control (E1) |
| Ladder | E4 | E7 | E34 | Negative Control | E36 | E37 | P2 | Positive Control (E1) |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

The first Gel finishes the first go through of ITS1
the secound Gel redos some of the samples that did not work well the first time
