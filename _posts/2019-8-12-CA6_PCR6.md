Samples E27 E28 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 E37 E40 sed in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, CA6.38R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), CA6.38L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 132.3 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 183.75 micoleters|
|CA6.38R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|CA6.38L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|BAS (Borine Serum Albumin)| 1 microliter|


24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
there was no positive control was available

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

This PCR was set to 
Previous PCRs were showing up smeared and unclear. This could be becuase of too much amplified DNA

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E27 E28 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 E37 E40 e two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E27 | E28 | E29 | Negative Control | E30 | E31 | E32 | Positive control - E7 |
| Ladder | E33 | E34 | E35 | Negative Control | E36 | E37 | E40 | Positive control - E7 |


The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
