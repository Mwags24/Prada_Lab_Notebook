## Testing DNA samples

### Procedure

1 microliter of DNA was combinded with 1 microliter of 5x loading Buffer (dye) for the samples

DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

**new agarose was used for this gel**

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E1 | E4 | E16 | E17 | E19 | E20 | E24 | E30 | E32 | E34 | E35 | E36 | E37 | E44 | E45 | E47 | E52 | E53 | E54 | 

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
