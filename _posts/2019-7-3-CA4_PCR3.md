##  E27 E82 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 E37 E40

### Procedure

Samples E27 E82 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 E37 E40 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, CA4.86R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), CA4.86L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 132.3 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 183.75 micoleters|
|CA4.86R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|CA4.86L Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
E1 was used as a positive control

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|50°C|1:00|35|
|4|72°C|0:15|35|
|5|72°C|2:00|1|
|6|4°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E27 E82 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 E37 E40 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E27 | E28 | E29 | Negative Control | E30 | E31 | E32 | Positive Control (E1) |
| Ladder | E33 | E34 | E35 | Negative Control | E36 | E37 | E38 | Positive Control (E1) |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

Many of these had multiple bands show up meaning somthing else was amplified from the sample. further tests will try to eliminate that band

Originally the bottom bands were thought to be in the right place while the top bands were not the correct amplification
    However after doing more PCRs is was reaized that it was the other way around. 
This also cleared up the mystery of why it seemed like E30 E34 E35 E36 and E37 were working when they usually do not show up in PCRs

some of these should be tested agian to confirm this conclusion s correct.
