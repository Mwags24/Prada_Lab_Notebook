##  E37 E40 E41 E42 E43 E44 / E45 E46 E47 E48 E49 E50

### Procedure

PCR was performed on samples that have not been used before, these samples are from aliquoites of DNA extractions becuase the original coral samples are not available

Samples E37 E40 E41 E42 E43 E44 E45 E46 E47 E48 E49 E50 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)

Component| Volume for 12 reactions (+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 113.4 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 157.5 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 12.6 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 microm7141999
olar)| 12.6 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 12 tubes 
For the 2 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

1.5 microleters of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube
and 1 microleter of water was added to two tubes for the controls

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|52°C|0:40|35|
|4|72°C|0:30|35|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliter Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E37 E40 E41 E42 E43 E44 E45 E46 E47 E48 E49 E50 and the three controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E37 | E40 | E41 | Control | E42 | E43 | E44 | Control |
| Ladder | E45 | E46 | E47 | Control | E48 | E49 | E50 | Control |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
