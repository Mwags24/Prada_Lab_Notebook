## E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 E15 E16 E17

### Procedure

2069.6 microleters of buffer and 10.4 microleters of quant it reagent were mixed into a master mixed

190 microleters of the master mix was mixed with 10 microleters of standard 1 and standard 2
199 microletersof the master mix was mixed with 1 microleter of each DNA sample 

the samples were run through the Qubit and the nanograms of DNA per microleter was determinded 

|Sample|Qubit 1| Qubit 2|
|----|-------|--------|
|Standard 1|39.29 ng/μl|n/a|
|Standard 2|24737.70 ng/μl|n/a|
|E8|59.8 ng/μl|60.0 ng/μl|
|E9|18.6 ng/μl|18.6 ng/μl|
|E10|28.8 ng/μl|29.0 ng/μl|
|E11|34.0 ng/μl|34.0 ng/μl|
|E12|40.0 ng/μl|38.6 ng/μl|
|E15|42.8 ng/μl|43.2 ng/μl|
|E16|28.6 ng/μl|29.0 ng/μl|
|E17|76.4 ng/μl|75.2 ng/μl|


### Notes
all of these amounts of DNA are relativly good and should show up in PCRs
