##   E25 E26 E27 E28 E29 E30 / E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36

### Procedure

Samples E25 E26 E27 E28 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 12 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 113.4 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 157.5 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 12.6 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 12.6 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 12 tubes 
For the 4 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

**The denaturing, Annealing, and Extension times were changed from 15 seconds to 30/60/15 and the cycles were increased to 35**

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|94°C|2:00|1|
|2|94°C|**0:30**|**35**|
|3|59°C|**0:60**|**35**|
|4|72°C|**0:15**|**35**|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E25 E26 E27 E28 E29 E30 E31 E32 E33 E34 E35 E36 and the four controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E25 | E26 | E27 | Control | E28 | E29 | E30 | Control |
| Ladder | E31 | E32 | E33 | Control | E34 | E35 | E36 | Control |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

the E28 DNA used was not the most recent extraction
E35 and E36 did not get the full 24 micoleters of Master mix  

The length of the bands do not match up with the expected B7sym15 length due to them having a attached tail to aid in sequencing them.
