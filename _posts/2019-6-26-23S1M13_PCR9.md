## P2 P3 P11 P13 P14 P15

### Procedure

Samples P2 P3 P11 P13 P14 P15 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, 23S1M13 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), 23S2M13 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 66.15 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 91.9 micoleters|
|23S1M13 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| **~12.5** micoleters|
|23S2M13 Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| **~12.5** micoleters|

**A higher percentage of primer was used to determine if this leads to more succsessful results**

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the negative control 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
E2 was used for the positive control

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to run **for 45 cycles**

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|**45**|
|3|55°C|1:00|**45**|
|4|72°C|0:15|**45**|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|4°C|hold|-|

The amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  P2 P3 P11 P13 P14 P15 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | P2 | P3 | P11 | Negative Control | P12 | P14 | P15 | Positive Control (E2) |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

A higher percentage of primer was used to determine if this leads to more succsessful results

The thermomixer was set to 45 cycles
