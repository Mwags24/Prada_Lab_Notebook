##   E1 E3 E51 E52 E53 E54 / E5 E6 P13 P14 P15 P16

### Procedure

Samples  E1 E3 E51 E52 E53 E54 E5 E6 P13 P14 P15 P16  were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 12 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 113.4 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 157.5 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 12.6 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 12.6 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 12 tubes 
For the 4 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

**The denaturing, Annealing, and Extension times were changed from 15 seconds to 30/60/15 and the cycles were increased to 35**

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|94°C|2:00|1|
|2|94°C|**0:30**|**35**|
|3|59°C|**0:60**|**35**|
|4|72°C|**0:15**|**35**|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E1 E3 E51 E52 E53 E54 E5 E6 P13 P14 P15 P16  and the four controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E1 | E3 | E51 | Control | E52 | E53 | E54 | Control |
| Ladder | E5 | E6 | P13 | Control | P14 | P15 | P16 | Control |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
