## E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5

### Procedure

After the samples E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 were qubited the information was used to determine the concentrations needed to create a mix with 100 ng of each primer 

to determine the microliters needed using the following equation

**100ng/ x ng/μl = x μl**

These are the amounts calculated

|Sample|**24F**|**28S**|**IA2**|**ITS1**| 
|---|-----|-----|-----|----|
|**E1**|2.25 μl|1.83 |1.08 |3.19 |
|**E2**|1.36 μl|1.17 |0.97 |3.34 |
|**E3**|1.89 μl|1.25 |0.97 |4.72 |
|**E4**|1.82 μl|1.23 |1.00 |3.24 |
|**E5**|1.89 μl|1.26 |0.94 |3.45 |
|**P1**|2.56 μl|2.24 |5.32 |3.73 |
|**P2**|2.52 μl|3.85 |7.81 |6.85 |
|**P3**|5.53 μl|2.24 |7.63 |9.85 |
|**P4**|2.23 μl|2.11 |5.67 |4.13 |
|**P5**|2.17 μl|12.02|10.48|4.85 |

These amounts were added to the corresponding tubes so that each tube has 100 ng of each post PCR DNA.

For 24F **E1-5** was taken from the [7-15-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-15-24F_PCR1 %}) tube. **P1-5** was taken from the [7-16-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-16-24F_PCR5 %}) tube

For 28S **E1-5** was taken from the [7-17-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-17-28S_PCR1 %}) tube. **P1-5** was taken from the [7-22-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-22-28S_PCR5 %})

For IA2 **E1-5** was taken from [7-23-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-23-IA2_PCR1 %}). 
**P1 and P3-5** was taken from [7-24-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-24-IA2_PCR5 %}) **P2** was from [7-29-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-29-IA2_PCR6 %}).

For ITS1 **E1 E2 E3 and E5** was taken from [6-18-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-18-ITS1_PCR1 %}) and **E4** was taken from [6-19-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-19-ITS1_PCR6 %}). 
**P1-5** was taken from [6-19-19]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-6-19-ITS1_PCR5 %}).
