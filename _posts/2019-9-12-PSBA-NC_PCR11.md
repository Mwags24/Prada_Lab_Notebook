## E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 E13 E14

### Procedure

PsbA-NC is a plastid primer - [Primer info]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-29-Pimer_Info %})

Samples E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 E13 E14 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

Two master mixes were made
A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, 1,788F Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), 2,218R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)

This Master Mix x4.5

|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 66.15 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 91.9 micoleters|
|1,788F Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 7.35 micoleters|
|2,218R Primer  (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 7.35 micoleters|
|BAS (Borine Serum Albumin)| .5 microliter|


24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 7 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls of 25 micoleters water 
no positive control was available

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|94°C|2:00|1|
|2|**63**|1:30|1|
|3|72°C|2:00|1|
|4|94°C|0:45|36|
|5|**63**|1:00|36|
|6|72°C|1:30|36|
|7|72°C|2:00|1|
|8|4°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 E13 E14 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E8 | E9 | E10 | Negative Control | E11 | E12 | E13 | E14 |


The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes
