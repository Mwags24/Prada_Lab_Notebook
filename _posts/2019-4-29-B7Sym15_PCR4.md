##   E7 E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 (#2)

### Procedure

A new set of B7Sym15 Primers were created to test if this was the reason no DNA showed up in the last test.

Samples E7 E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 6 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 59.85 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 78.75 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.3 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.3 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 6 tubes 
For the 2 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube
and 1 microleter of water was added to two tubes for the controls

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 


|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|94°C|2:00|1|
|2|94°C|0:15|32|
|3|59°C|0:15|32|
|4|72°C|0:15|32|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E7 E8 E9 E10 E11 E12 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E7 | E8 | E9 | Control | E10 | E11 | E12 | Control |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 30 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes
There was not improved results after creating new primers
