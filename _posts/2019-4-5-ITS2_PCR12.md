##   E16 E17 E19 E20 E21 E24

### Procedure

Samples E16 E17 E19 E20 E21 E24 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 6 reactions|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 57 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 75 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 6 tubes 
For the 2 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube
and 1 microleter of water was added to two tubes for the controls

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|52°C|0:40|35|
|4|72°C|0:30|35|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 3 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E16 E17 E19 E20 E21 E24 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E16 | E17 | E19 | Control | E20 | E21 | E24 | Control |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 30 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

###Notes

E20 has had a band show up in the wrong place twice now, 
E20 will be run in a PCR one more time to try to fix this, before trying somthing new
