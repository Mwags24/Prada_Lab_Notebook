## E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E18 E25 E31 E42 P2 P12

### Procedure

IA2 is also known as PsbA-Coding and is a plastid primer

Samples E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E18 E25 E31 E42 P2 P12 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, IA2F Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar), IA2R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 14 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 132.3 micoleters|
|mytaq mix| 183.75 micoleters|
|IA2F Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|IA2R Primer (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 14.7 micoleters|
|BAS (Borine Serum Albumin)| 1 microliter|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 14 tubes 
For the 2 negative controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added
E6 was used as the positive control

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to IA2

the temp was set to 52.2.5°C and the cycles were set to 33 to try to improve the gel.

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|33|
|3|52.25°C|1:00|33|
|4|72°C|0:15|33|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|4°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples  E53 E54 P13 P14 P15 P16 E18 E25 E31 E42 P2 P12 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First 3 microliters of the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E53 | E54 | P13 | Negative Control | P14 | P15 | P16 | Positive Control (E6) |
| Ladder | E18 | E25 | E31 | Negative Control | E42 | P2 | P12 | Positive Control (E6) |

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 60 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
