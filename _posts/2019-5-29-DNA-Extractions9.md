## E8 E9 E10 E16 E17 E19 E20 E21 E24 E28 E30 E32 P14 P15  

* These are the samples that after multiple attempts have not shown up in any ITS2 PCR's 

### Procedure

added 180 microliters ATL to 14 1.5ml eppendorf tubes
Labeled the tubes acoarding to the code 

Took original coral samples of samples from -20° freezer 

For each coral:
took coral out of tube 
placed on a sterolized glass slide
cut small piece of tissue off with sterlolized scissors
placed in the corresponding eppendorf tubes

then  20 microliters of Protinase k was added to each

samples were placed in Thermomixer set to 50°C and 600rpm

Took samples out of thermomixer after 1 hour
Vortexted samples after observing the tissue had been dissolved

added 200 microliters Al buffer to each and Vortexted
added 200 microliters of 100% ethonol 

transfered samples to spin columns
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

transfered spin columns to new collection tubes 
added 500 microliters of buffer AW1
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

transfered spin columns to new collection tubes
added 500 microliters of buffer AW2
centrifuged for 3 minutes at 14000 rpm

transfered spin columns to eppendorf tubes
added 50 microliters of buffer AE (warmed to 56°C)
let liquid incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature 
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm
added 20 microliters of buffer AE (warmed to 56°C)
incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

P14 and P15 were placed in box labeled "ALiquoted DNA smaples"
The Eunicia samples were placed in a box "Eunicia DNA extractions"
both boxes were put in the -20° standup freezer
