## E1 E5 E12 E18 E24

### Procedure

Samples E1 E5 E12 E18 E24 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 6 reactions (plus 10% extra)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 62.7 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 82.5 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.6 micoleters|
|ITS2 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.6 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 6 tubes 

1 microleter of the DNA samples was added to the tubes and 1 microleter of water was added to another tube as a control

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 

|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|92°C|3:00|1|
|2|92°C|0:30|35|
|3|52°C|0:40|35|
|4|72°C|0:30|35|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

___________
using these amplified DNA samples a Gel was created

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

2g agarose and 100ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 100ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 5 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E1, E5, E12, E18, E24, and the control were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

|ladder | E1 | E5 | E12 | E18 | E24 | control|

The voltage was set to 100V and run for 30 minutes


This is the resulting Gel
