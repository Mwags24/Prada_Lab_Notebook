##   E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 

### Procedure

- [Primer info]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-7-29-Pimer_Info %})

Samples E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 were used in this PCR (polimerase chain reaction) reaction 

First A Master Mix of water, 2x mytaq mix, B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar), B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)


|Component| Volume for 6 reactions(+5% error)|
|---------|---------------------------|
|Water| 59.85 micoleters|
|2x mytaq mix| 78.75 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Reverse (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.3 micoleters|
|B7Sym15 Primer Forward (concentration: 10 micromolar)| 6.3 micoleters|

24 micoleters of this master mix was added to 6 tubes 
For the 2 controls 12.5 micoleters water and 12.5 micoleters mytaq mix were added

**1.5 micoleters of DNA were added instead of 1 microleter**

**1.5** microleter of the DNA samples was added to the coresponding tube

The samples were then placed in the thermocycler set to 


|Step|Temperature|Duration|cycles|
|----|-------|--------|-------|
|1|94°C|2:00|1|
|2|94°C|0:15|32|
|3|59°C|0:15|32|
|4|72°C|0:15|32|
|5|72°C|5:00|1|
|6|10°C|hold|-|

these amplified DNA samples were then tested by making a gel

to create the Gel the following steps were taken 

1.5g agarose and 75ml 1X TAE buffer were mixed to make a 2% agarose 75ml gel mix 
the mix was microwaved and swirled until there were no flakes 
then 1 microliters Gelgreen was added

the mix was left to cool for 5 minutes then poured into the gel mold
the gel was left to harden for 30 minutes 

once hardened enough Used TAE buffer was poured into the gel box to cover the mold

5 microliter aliquots of DNA samples E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 and the two controls were made 
1 microliter of 5x loading dye was added to each

First the HyperLadder 100bp was added to the first well of the mold 
then the DNA samples were each added to the wells in the following order 

| Ladder | E1 | E2 | E3 | Control | E4 | E5 | E6 | Control |

The voltage was set to 120V and run for 45 minutes


This is the resulting Gel

### Notes

E2 was the only sample to show up at all
it was extremely faint.
compared to the test with more time this E2 was fainter
