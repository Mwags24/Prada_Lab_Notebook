## E2, E3, E4 

### Procedure

added 180 microliters ATL to four 1.5ml eppendorf tubes
Labeled the tubes E2, E3, E4

Took original coral samples of sample E2, E3, E4 from -20° freezer 

For each coral:
took coral out of tube 
placed on a sterolized glass slide
cut small piece of tissue off with sterlolized scissors
placed in the corresponding eppendorf tubes

added 20 microliters of Protinase k to each

samples were placed in Thermomixer set to 50°C and 600rpm

Took samples out of thermomixer after 1 hour
Vortexted samples after observing the tissue had been dissolved

added 200 microliters Al buffer to each and Vortexted
added 200 microliters of 100% ethonol 

transfered samples to spin columns
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

transfered spin columns to new collection tubes 
added 500 microliters of buffer AW1
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

transfered spin columns to new collection tubes
added 500 microliters of buffer AW2
centrifuged for 3 minutes at 14000 rpm

transfered spin columns to eppendorf tubes
added 50 microliters of buffer AE (warmed to 56°C)
let liquid incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature 
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm
added 20 microliters of buffer AE (warmed to 56°C)
incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature
centrifuged for 1 minute at 8000 rpm

labeled as E2, E3, E4
placed in box labeled "DNA Extractons Genus: Eunicia"
placed box in -20° standup freezer
